I am a PhD candidate at the University of Salzburg, Austria. Before I began my degree(s) at the University of Salzburg, I held teaching positions at Salzburg College (Austria) and two teaching/research assistantships at Bowling Green State University (Ohio, USA). I received my Bachelor's degree in German Studies, an individualized minor in Translation and Intermediality as well as a Master's degree in German Studies with a focus on variationist sociolinguistics and second language acquisition from Bowling Green State University. 

For the better part of four years, my principal research areas have been variationist sociolinguistics and second language acquisition, especially in regard to quantitative approaches and statistical methods. My work investigates the acquisition, use and perception of variable linguistic features, structures and systems. In particular, I am highly interested in how L2 learners interact and deal with the rich variation present in Austria's linguistic landscape as well as which factors predict differential outcomes in sociolinguistic competence in the naturalistic sphere. My goal with this research is to shed light on the dynamic interplay of cognitive, socioaffective, and linguistic factors in the sociolinguistic development process and answer other outstanding questions, such as the extent to which different varieties of the same language (e.g., English) differently impact the acquisition of sociolinguistic variation by second language learners. 

I am also interested in other related fields, such as digital humanities and statistics. For my dissertation, I have developed an elicitation method using virtual reality that serves in part as a valuable substitute for sociolinguistic interviews and, more generally, as a way to reconcile ecological validity and experimental control in order to elicit realistic speech data (Wirtz, 2022). I am also very interested in a wide range of statistical modeling techniques, particularly within the Bayesian framework. In my dissertation, I take a multi-method approach (Seawright 2016), using Bayesian multilevel modeling to explore the impact of my set of predictors on sociolinguistic development, buttressed by qualitative content analyses as a means to explain meaningful statistical effects.

# Research Interests
----------------
- Second language use and development 
- Intra-individual variation and variability in L2 development from psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic perspectives
- Cognition-affect interface
- Research methods and statistics
- Contextual factors (classroom and non-instructional settings, differences in input, family and peer circumstances)
- Methodological challenges for empirical research, e.g., reconciling quantitative and qualitative methods as a means of explaining predications, capitalizing on new methodological designs (e.g., virtual reality) to control for the role of context
- Second language development in the context of sociolinguistic and spatial variation
- (Acquisition of) Bidialectalism in L2 learning
- Dialectometry and geostatistical methods to explore the interplay of social, spatial, and linguistic variation
