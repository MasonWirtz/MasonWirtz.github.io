Mason A. Wirtz is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Salzburg, Austria. He holds a BA (2015–2019) and MA (2019–2020) in German studies from Bowling Green State University (Ohio, USA) and a PhD (2020–2023) in German linguistics from the University of Salzburg, Austria with a focus on second language acquisition (title: *Inter- and Intra-Individual Variation in Adult L2 Sociolinguistic Repertoires. Dynamics of Linguistic, Socioaffective and Cognitive Factors*). He is also a recipient of the Young Investigators Award from the University of Salzburg (2022).
 
His primary research interests include psycholinguistics, variationist sociolinguistics, and second language acquisition in adulthood, especially as concerns quantitative approaches and statistical methods. His research sheds light on the role of domain-general cognitive functioning alongside psychosocial and linguistic factors on the acquisition of sociolinguistic variation in L2 learning during (young) adulthood, as well as how socioaffective, experiential, and contextual variables impact on additional language learning by mature adults. Additionally, he is interested in intra-individual variation and variability in L2 development from psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic perspectives as well as methodological challenges for empirical research, e.g., reconciling quantitative and qualitative methods as a means of explaining predications and capitalizing on new methodological designs and instruments (e.g., virtual reality) to control for the role of context. His work has appeared in international scientific journals such as *Research Methods in Applied Linguistics* and *Studies in Second Language Acquisition*.
