I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Salzburg, Austria, in the MuSt Lab (PIs: Prof. Stephan Elspaß, Prof. Simon Pickl, and Dr. Konstantin Niehaus). I hold a BA (2015–2019) and MA (2019–2020) in German studies from Bowling Green State University (Ohio, USA) and a PhD (2020–2023) in German linguistics from the University of Salzburg, Austria with a focus on second language acquisition (supervised by Prof. Andrea Ender, University of Salzburg, PD Irmtraud Kaiser, University of Salzburg, and Prof. Simone E. Pfenninger, University of Zurich). 
 
My primary research interests include psycholinguistics, variationist sociolinguistics, and second language acquisition in adulthood, especially as it concerns quantitative approaches and statistical methods. My research sheds light on the role of domain-general cognitive functioning alongside psychosocial and linguistic factors on the acquisition of sociolinguistic variation in L2 learning during (young) adulthood, as well as how socioaffective, experiential, and contextual variables impact on additional language learning by mature adults. Additionally, I am interested in intra-individual variation and variability in L2 development from psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic perspectives as well as methodological challenges for empirical research, e.g., reconciling quantitative and qualitative methods as a means of explaining predications and capitalizing on new methodological designs and instruments (e.g., virtual reality) to control for the role of context. I also dabble in geostatistics and dialectometric methods and enjoy testing out new and innovative ways to visualize data for different audiences.
