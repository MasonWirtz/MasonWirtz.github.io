Currently, I am a research associate (pre-doc) at the University of Salzburg. My research is situated at the intersection between socio- and psycholinguistics, where I employ variationist approaches to second language acquisition. A recurring theme in my research is how second language (L2) learners in the Austro-Bavarian naturalistic sphere acquire sociolinguistic variation, both in production and perception, and how we can approach such research questions both methodologically and statistically. I also dabble in geostatistics, which comes in handy for my current position in the newly minted project [Muster und Strukturen der regionalen Sprachwirklichkeit](https://www.plus.ac.at/germanistik/forschung/muster-und-strukturen-der-regionalen-sprachwirklichkeit/), led by Stephan Elspa√ü, Simon Pickl, and Konstantin Niehaus. Prior to my current position, I held graduate teaching and research scholarships at Bowling Green State University.
