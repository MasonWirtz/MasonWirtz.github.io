I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich, Switzerland (2025-present). Prior to my current position, I was a postdoctoral research associate and senior scientist (2023-2024) and a research associate (2022-2023) at the University of Salzburg, Austria, I worked as a lecturer in German as a foreign/second language and as Academic Programs Manager at Salzburg College in Salzburg, Austria (2020), and I held graduate teaching and research scholarships at Bowling Green State University (2019-2020). Additionally, I have taught German as a second language courses at various adult education institutes in Austria (2021-2022). I received my BA (2015–2019) and MA (2019–2020) in German studies from Bowling Green State University (Ohio, USA) and my PhD (2020–2023) in German linguistics with a focus on second language acquisition and variationist sociolinguistics from the University of Salzburg, Austria (supervised by Prof. Andrea Ender, University of Salzburg, PD Irmtraud Kaiser, University of Salzburg, and Prof. Simone E. Pfenninger, University of Zurich). 
 
My primary research interests include psycholinguistics, variationist sociolinguistics, and second language acquisition (SLA) in adulthood, especially as concerns quantitative approaches and statistical methods. In my work on SLA, I am interested in the role of psychosocial, linguistic, and cognitive factors on the acquisition of sociolinguistic variation in L2 learning during (young) adulthood, and how socioaffective, experiential, and contextual variables impact additional language learning among mature adults. My habilitation project merges psycho- and sociolinguistic approaches in order to investigate how major life events (e.g., entry into the workforce, parenthood, retirement) affect language variation and change across the lifespan.
