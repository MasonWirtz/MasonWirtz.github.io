My name is Mason Wirtz and I am a doctoral candidate at the University of Salzburg with a focus on (variationist) sociolinguistics and second language acquisition.

In my current research, I explore how native English speakers learning German as a second language acquire sociolinguistic competence in the Bavarian-Austrian context and which dynamic constellation(s) of linguistic, socioaffective and cognitive factors influence this. 

On this website you can find my (scientific) biography and information about my teaching and research interests.
