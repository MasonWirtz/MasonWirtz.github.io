While teaching is often difficult, I could hardly imagine any other profession.
 
Since I was in school, I have always had a passion for teaching, first about music, then math and now in the field of languages (English and German).

To date, I have taught in a wide variety of areas, both in the Anglo-American and Austrian context. In Austria, I have led integration courses and taught in the university context. In addition to pure English and German language acquisition coursework, I have also had the opportunity to lead proseminars with a focus on linguistic anthropology, academic writing (English and German) and translation studies, both in face-to-face and online formats.  

This page houses a list of courses/workshops I have taught.
