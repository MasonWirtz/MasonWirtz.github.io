in prep. | <b> Inter- and Intra-Individual Variation in Adult L2 Sociolinguistic Repertoires. Dynamics of Linguistic, Socioaffective and Cognitive Factors.</b> <br> <u> Wirtz, Mason A. </u><br>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary> > This book constitutes two complementary holistic studies in the field of variationist second language acquisition (SLA) investigating how, when and why second language (L2) German learners in the Austro-Bavarian naturalistic context develop sociolinguistic competence, i.e., “the capacity to recognize and produce socially appropriate speech in context” (Lyster, 1994, p. 263). In the first cross-sectional study, we combine sophisticated quantitative group-level analyses with person-centered individual qualitative data, the goal being to explore the effects of linguistic, socioaffective and cognitive factors on 40 adult L2 learners’ inter-individual acquisition of sociolinguistic competence. The second study is the first in variationist SLA research to analyze intensive micro-longitudinal data: It scrutinizes micro-developmental trajectories in four L2 learners’ sociolinguistic production and perception during initial periods of residence in Austria and attempts to identify relevant environmental and psychological stimuli for change. Taken as a whole, this book makes a convincing methodological case to complement cross-sectional data with micro-longitudinal individual data so as to better reconcile generalizability, individuality and within-person variability. The results provide the field of variationist SLA with a more detailed mechanistic understanding of the acquisition and development of sociolinguistic competence in the non-instructed naturalistic sphere.</details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>
  
> This study is the first to explore micro-development in L2 sociolinguistic evaluative judgements of standard German and Austro-Bavarian dialect by adult German learners using dense time serial measurements. Intensive longitudinal data (10 observations per subject) were collected from 4 learners (2 directly after arrival in Austria, and 2 after 7 months of residence) at approximately weekly intervals over 3 months. We made use of fitted additive models (GAMs) with superimposed periods of significant change to identify rapid developmental phases in individual evaluative judgement trajectories. By triangulating GAMs with both qualitative introspective and retrodictive interview data, we identified environmental and psychological stimuli for change within each individual’s sociolinguistic micro-development. Concerning the time and timing of phase shifts, learners evinced both increasing and decreasing periods of significant change, notably independent of length of residence. Results revealed that dynamic constellations of identity- and agency-related factors alongside more intensive social interaction with the naturalistic context and target variety speakers at a given moment contribute to significant changes in sociolinguistic microdevelopment. We discuss findings from a complex dynamic systems perspective and highlight the necessity for micro-longitudinal studies in variationist SLA so as to better capture stimuli for change in learners’ evolving multivarietal sociolinguistic repertoires.

Wirtz, Mason A. / Pfenninger, Simone E. (under review, R&R submitted) <br> **Variability and Individual Differences in L2 Sociolinguistic Evaluations: The GROUP, the INDIVIDUAL and the HOMOGENEOUS ENSEMBLE.** <br> Submitted to: *Studies in Second Language Acquisition*.

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
  
> This study is the first to investigate subject-level variability in sociolinguistic evaluative judgements by 30 adult L2 German learners and explore whether the observed variability is characterizable as a function of individual differences in proficiency, exposure, and motivation. Since group-level estimates did not paint an accurate picture of the individual, we propose methods capable of integrating population-level estimates with person-/ensemble-centered approaches so as to reconcile generalizability and individuality. Using random effects from Bayesian mixed-effects models, we found that global subject-level variability in evaluative judgements was not predicted by individual differences. By building homogeneous ensembles (i.e., subgroups of individuals with similar evaluative judgements), however, it was possible to assess whether ensembles were characteristic of certain levels of individual differences. This ensemble-centered approach presents an innovative way to address the group-to-individual generalizability issue in cross-sectional data and transcend individual variety in order to make tentative generalizations of individual cases to wider populations.

> In the interdisciplinary ﬁeld of applied linguistics, research on the acquisition of sociolinguistic competence in the second language is growing quickly, yet comparatively little eﬀort has been dedicated to developing innovative data collection instruments that combat long-known methodological shortcomings. This pilot study, based on data from native German speakers from Austria, evaluates the use of virtual reality (VR) as a means to (a) compensate for weaknesses of the sociolinguistic/semi-directed interview in sociolinguistic research and (b) elicit mechanisms of linguistic convergence towards a respective interlocutor’s language variety. Qualitative content analysis showed high rates of immersiveness in interaction with the virtual interlocutors. The production data showed clear between-participant tendencies to converge to the respective virtual interlocutor’s Austrian dialect or standard German variety. These ﬁndings are discussed against the backdrop of L2 sociolinguistic acquisition research and highlight the necessity for methodological advances in data collection practices.

A Case Study in Light of COVID-19.** <br> *Frontiers: The Interdisciplinary Journal of Study Abroad*, 33(3), 59-69 <br> [article](https://frontiersjournal.org/index.php/Frontiers/article/view/548/474)

> The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced nearly every aspect of the academic world, and study abroad is no exception. Particularly in the foreign language learning sector, the unprecedented switch from in-class lectures to distance learning brought with it many challenges. Not only were language instructors tasked with creating an interactive language learning atmosphere from afar but continuing to spark student motivation while catering to a broad range of learning goals constituted a seemingly insurmountable obstacle. The following case study therefore seeks to provide an easily adaptable and interactive task-based activity for the German as a foreign language classroom that should support learners in gaining a deeper understanding of the social dimensions and usages of Austrian regional varieties. Furthermore, the activity is designed so as to be applicable in both an online as well as face-to-face classroom and accommodate foreign language instructors with less experience in digital course delivery and/or minimal access to learning management systems.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
  
> The focus on empirical methods in applied fields of science has inspired stark data-driven approaches. Of course, this reliance on data to advance our current state of knowledge necessitates the clear communication of said data. The question of how to communicate data context appropriately (i.e., as a function of the recipient party, physical circumstances et cetera), however, is less often foregrounded. The present contribution addresses this desideratum. Data visualizations present a compact way to effectively communicate large amounts of information. After discussing the necessity of data visualization both in the exploration and communication of data, I issue a plea to regard data visualization as a language in its own right, such that it––as with any other language––is multidimensional, multimodal and multivarietal. Much like communicating in a language is more than typing words into Google Translate, communicating via data visualization is not a matter of two clicks in Excel––it is a dynamic process that entails acquiring the context-dependent variation and multilingualism inherent to the language.
